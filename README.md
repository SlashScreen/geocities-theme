# Geocities theme.

I learned to code by making a geocities page back in the 90's. I like to imagine that tumblr is the geocities of this generation. Lots of young kids are making cool themes that happen to have dynamic content rather than all static .html files.

This is my throwback to the good ol' days.

# Installing

Just go to your [customize page](http://www.tumblr.com/customize) and paste the `theme.html` file into the custom HTML box. All of the images here are just for reference, the theme uses versions already uploaded to tumblr.
